# Ongoing Changes and Potential Improvements

This document tracks ongoing and potential future changes for the PicoMol project.

## Proposed Ongoing Changes (User-Friendly Focus)

1. **Add a screenshot feature** to capture the current view of the protein structure. ✅
2. **Provide tooltips and inline help** for all controls and options. ✅
    - Tooltips have been added to all major controls in the UI, providing concise descriptions for each feature. Users now receive inline help by hovering over buttons, fields, and options.
3. **Implement a welcome screen or onboarding tutorial** for first-time users. ✅
    - A welcome dialog now appears on first launch, introducing PicoMol and offering a "Show this on startup" option. Uses a native dialog for best cross-platform compatibility.
4. **Add undo/redo support** for user actions.
5. **Make file loading and saving as simple as possible** (with clear dialogs and recent files list).
6. **Improve error messages** to be actionable and user-friendly.
7. **Add a preferences/settings dialog** for customizing appearance and behavior.
8. **Ensure accessibility** (keyboard navigation, colorblind-friendly palettes).
9. **Allow users to reset the view or return to defaults easily.**
10. **Add a “feedback” button** for users to quickly report issues or suggest improvements.
11. **Provide a simple “about” dialog** with version info and credits.

Feel free to update this list as development progresses or new ideas arise.
